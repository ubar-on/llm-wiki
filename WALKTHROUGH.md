# llm-wiki Walkthrough

A guided tour for new users. Read this top to bottom the first time, then use it as a reference.

## Part 1: Introduction

### What is an LLM Wiki?

Andrej Karpathy described a pattern where an LLM reads raw source material, writes cross-linked wiki articles from it, files Q&A answers back into the knowledge base, and periodically lints for gaps and contradictions. The result is a knowledge base that compounds over time: each new source enriches existing pages, and each query can surface connections across everything ingested so far.

This plugin implements that pattern inside Obsidian.

### Why Obsidian?

Obsidian stores everything as plain markdown files on disk. That means:

- **Graph view** renders your `[[wikilinks]]` as a visual network for free
- **Dataview** queries frontmatter across all pages, so you can build dynamic tables of concepts, people, or sources
- **Web Clipper** saves articles directly to your vault's `raw/` folder, ready to ingest
- **Marp** can export any page as a slide deck by adding `marp: true` to frontmatter

No lock-in. The files are yours.

### What this plugin does

Six operations, invoked from a Claude Code session:

| Operation | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `init <name>` | Scaffolds a new wiki with directory structure, schema, and git tracking |
| `ingest <path\|url>` | Saves a source to raw/articles/. Large documents are split into chapter files automatically. |
| `compile [<path>]` | Reads raw sources, creates/updates wiki pages with entity extraction |
| `query <question>` | Searches the wiki, synthesizes an answer with wikilink citations |
| `lint` | Audits for dead links, orphans, missing sections, index drift, and large-document integrity |
| `split <path\|name>` | Retroactively splits a single-file ingest into per-chapter article files |
| `update <name>` | Re-ingests a revised edition of a document; only changed chapters are re-processed |
| `remove <name>` | Deletes a wiki and all its contents |

---

## Part 2: Key Concepts

### Wiki structure

Every wiki lives at `$LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/<name>/`:

```
<name>/
├── raw/                  ← immutable source drops (never edited by LLM)
│   ├── articles/         ← text source documents
│   └── attachments/      ← images and binary files
├── wiki/                 ← LLM-owned pages
│   ├── index.md          ← catalog, read first before any other page
│   ├── queries/          ← filed query answers
│   └── <concept>.md      ← entity and concept pages
├── outputs/
│   └── reports/          ← dated lint reports
├── CLAUDE.md             ← wiki schema and conventions
├── log.md                ← append-only operation log
├── .gitignore
└── qmd.yml               ← search collection config
```

The `raw/` folder is sacred: sources go in, nothing comes out. The LLM writes only to `wiki/`.

### Active wiki detection

When you run any operation, the plugin walks up from your current working directory looking for a folder that contains both `CLAUDE.md` and a `wiki/` subfolder. The first match becomes the active wiki. If nothing is found, it lists available wikis and asks which one to use.

This means you can `cd` into a wiki root before running commands, or run from anywhere and let the plugin ask.

### CLAUDE.md as schema

`CLAUDE.md` is the contract between you and the LLM. It defines:

- Directory layout and what each folder is for
- Entity templates (concept, person, source-summary) with their frontmatter schemas
- Naming conventions (lowercase-kebab-case filenames, `[[wikilinks]]` for internal links)
- Log format, index format, cross-reference rules

The schema co-evolves with the wiki. If you want to add a new entity type or change a convention, edit `CLAUDE.md` and the LLM will follow it on the next operation.

### Entity types

Three page types, each with a frontmatter schema:

**concept.md** — an idea, technology, or event:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [domain]
type: concept
status: active
---
```

**person.md** — a named individual:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [domain, person]
type: person
status: active
---
```

**source-summary.md** — a processed source document:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [domain]
type: source-summary
source-url: https://...
---
```

Standardized frontmatter is what makes Dataview queries work across the whole wiki.

### Wikilinks and compounding

Every page links to related pages using `[[wikilinks]]`. After each ingest, the plugin runs a backlink audit: it greps existing pages for mentions of newly created page titles and adds wikilinks where they're missing. This keeps the graph dense.

The compounding effect comes from this density. When you query the wiki, the LLM follows wikilinks one level deep to gather context. A well-linked wiki surfaces connections that no single source contains.

### qmd (optional)

qmd provides hybrid BM25 + vector search over the wiki. For small wikis (under ~50 pages), reading `index.md` is fast enough. For larger wikis, qmd becomes essential for finding relevant pages without reading everything.

The plugin always uses the full path to qmd (`~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/qmd`) and falls back gracefully to index-based search if qmd isn't available.

### Auto-commit

Every operation ends with a git commit to the Obsidian vault. This gives you a full history of how the wiki evolved, lets you diff any operation, and makes it safe to experiment.

## Part 3: Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — for automatic dependency installation
- **Git** — for auto-committing wiki changes, with `user.name` and `user.email` configured
- **Obsidian vault** — defaults to `~/ObsidianVault/`. Override with environment variables before starting a session:
  ```bash
  export LLM_WIKI_VAULT=/path/to/your/vault   # vault root (default: ~/ObsidianVault)
  export LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR=Knowledge             # wiki subdir (default: 03-Resources)
  ```

Verify before installing:

```bash
node --version                        # should be 18+
git --version                         # should be 2.x
git config user.name                  # should return your name
ls $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/
```

### Install from the upstream marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add ekadetok/llm-wiki
/plugin install llm-wiki@llm-wiki
```

### Install from a fork (recommended for modified or personal versions)

If you are using a forked version (e.g. `ubar-on/llm-wiki`):

```
/plugin marketplace add ubar-on/llm-wiki
/plugin install llm-wiki@ubar-on-llm-wiki
```

To pick up updates after pushing changes to your fork:

```
/plugin marketplace update ubar-on-llm-wiki
/plugin update llm-wiki@ubar-on-llm-wiki
/reload-plugins
```

### Install from a local directory (active development)

If you have a local clone and want changes picked up immediately without pushing to a remote, install from the local path. Changes to files on disk are used in-place — no reinstall needed, only a reload.

> **Environment note:** `/plugin` and `/reload-plugins` commands work only in the Claude Code CLI REPL (`claude` in a terminal). In the VSCode extension, use `/plugins` to open the plugin manager UI, then reload the window to apply changes.

**Step 1 — First-time setup (run once in a terminal):**

```
claude
/plugin uninstall llm-wiki
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/local/llm-wiki
/plugin install llm-wiki@llm-wiki
```

The uninstall step removes any existing marketplace install that would conflict (both use source name `llm-wiki`). Skip it if you have no prior install.

**Step 2 — After any code change:**

- **CLI:** `/reload-plugins`
- **VSCode extension:** open a new Claude session window (Developer: Reload Window is not sufficient)

### Verify installation

In a Claude Code session, `/llm-wiki:wiki` should appear in the skill list. Try:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki
```

You should see the argument hint: `[--wiki <name>] init <name> | ingest <path|url> | compile [<path>] | query <question> | lint | split <path|name> | update <name> | remove <name>`.

To confirm which version is installed, run any wiki operation. The preflight READY line includes `SKILL_VERSION=<ver>`. If it shows an older version than expected, run the update commands above.

### Dependencies

`qmd` and `marp-cli` install automatically when you start a new Claude Code session after installing the plugin. The SessionStart hook runs `npm install` in the plugin data directory if the sentinel file `~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/.deps-ok` is missing.

To verify they installed:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/qmd
ls ~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/marp
```

## Part 4: Your First Wiki (Guided Walkthrough)

Work through these steps in order. Each step builds on the previous one.

---

### Step 1: Init a wiki

```
/llm-wiki:wiki init test-wiki
```

**What happens:**

1. Creates `$LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/` with `raw/articles/`, `raw/attachments/`, `wiki/queries/`, and `outputs/reports/`
2. Writes `CLAUDE.md` with the full schema
3. Writes `wiki/index.md` with an empty catalog template
4. Writes `log.md` with an empty log template
5. Writes `.gitignore` and `qmd.yml`
6. Commits everything: `init: test-wiki wiki`
7. If qmd is available, creates a search collection and embeds the (empty) wiki
8. Prints Web Clipper setup instructions

**Verify from terminal:**

```bash
ls -la $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/
cat $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/CLAUDE.md
cat $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/wiki/index.md
git -C $LLM_WIKI_VAULT log --oneline -1
```

**Expected:**

- Directory exists with `raw/`, `wiki/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `qmd.yml`
- `CLAUDE.md` contains the full schema with entity templates and conventions
- `wiki/index.md` has the empty catalog template with a comment block
- Git log shows `init: test-wiki wiki`

---

### Step 2: Ingest a local file

First, create a test source:

```bash
cat > $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/raw/articles/2026-04-05-test-article.md << 'EOF'
# The History of Markdown

John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 with contributions from Aaron Swartz.
It was designed as a plain-text formatting syntax that converts to HTML.
Today Markdown is used on GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Obsidian.
EOF
```

Then ingest it. Change to the wiki root first so active wiki detection finds it:

```bash
cd $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki
```

```
/llm-wiki:wiki ingest raw/articles/2026-04-05-test-article.md
```

**What happens:**

1. Detects active wiki from cwd, reads `CLAUDE.md`
2. Reads the source file, classifies it as `article`
3. Saves to `raw/articles/` with frontmatter
4. Appends to `log.md`, commits
5. Prints: "Source saved. Run wiki compile to integrate."

**Verify:**

```bash
ls raw/articles/
cat log.md
git -C $LLM_WIKI_VAULT log --oneline -3
```

**Expected:**

- `raw/articles/` contains the saved source file
- `log.md` has an ingest entry with date
- Git log shows the ingest commit

---

### Step 2b: Compile into wiki pages

```
/llm-wiki:wiki compile
```

**What happens:**

1. Identifies uncompiled sources in `raw/articles/`
2. Creates `wiki/history-of-markdown.md` (source-summary page)
3. Creates `wiki/john-gruber.md` (person page)
4. Creates `wiki/aaron-swartz.md` (person page)
5. May create concept pages for Markdown, HTML, GitHub, etc.
6. Runs backlink audit
7. Updates `wiki/index.md`
8. Appends to `log.md`, commits

**Verify:**

```bash
ls wiki/
cat wiki/index.md
cat log.md
git -C $LLM_WIKI_VAULT log --oneline -3
```

**Expected:**

- `wiki/` contains multiple new `.md` files
- `index.md` has entries under a domain heading
- `log.md` has a compile entry with date and page count
- Git log shows the compile commit

---

### Step 3: Ingest from a URL

```
/llm-wiki:wiki ingest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
```

**What happens:**

The plugin uses WebFetch to retrieve the page content, saves it to `raw/articles/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-markdown.md` with frontmatter, appends to `log.md`, and commits. It does not create wiki pages — use `compile` for that.

This is the primary workflow for building up a wiki from web research: clip or fetch articles, ingest them, then compile to create wiki pages.

---

### Step 4: Query the wiki

```
/llm-wiki:wiki query "Who created Markdown and when?"
```

**What happens:**

1. Detects active wiki, reads `CLAUDE.md`
2. If qmd is available, runs a hybrid search query. Otherwise reads `index.md` and identifies relevant pages
3. Opens the relevant pages, follows one level of wikilinks for additional context
4. Synthesizes an answer in prose with `[[wikilinks]]` as citations
5. Answer synthesized AND automatically filed to `wiki/queries/`
6. Asks: "Promote this to a concept page? (y/n)"
7. Appends to `log.md`, commits

**Example answer format:**

> Markdown was created by [[john-gruber]] in 2004, with significant contributions from [[aaron-swartz]]. It was designed as a plain-text formatting syntax that converts cleanly to HTML...

**Verify:**

```bash
cat log.md    # should have a query entry
git -C $LLM_WIKI_VAULT log --oneline -3
```

**Filing answers back:**

Answers are automatically filed to `wiki/queries/<slug>.md`. Then the plugin offers to promote the answer to `wiki/<slug>.md` as a full concept page. Promotion is how the wiki grows from queries, not just ingests.

---

### Step 5: Lint the wiki

```
/llm-wiki:wiki lint
```

**What happens:**

1. Reads all files in `wiki/`
2. Builds a link graph from all `[[wikilinks]]`
3. Runs the lint script if available, otherwise checks manually
4. Reports and fixes:
   - **Dead links**: creates stub pages for `[[wikilinks]]` pointing to nonexistent files
   - **Orphan pages**: lists pages with no inbound links, suggests where to add links
   - **Missing sections**: adds empty `## Counter-Arguments and Gaps` sections
   - **Contradictions**: lists pages with `[!WARNING]` markers
   - **Index drift**: adds missing entries, removes dead ones
5. Saves lint report to `outputs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-lint.md`
6. Appends to `log.md`, commits

**Verify:**

```bash
cat log.md    # should have a lint entry with issue count
ls outputs/reports/
git -C $LLM_WIKI_VAULT log --oneline -3
```

After a fresh ingest of one small article, lint will likely find a few orphan pages or missing sections. That's normal and expected.

---

### Step 6: Open in Obsidian

Open Obsidian and navigate to `$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/test-wiki/`.

**Graph view:** Open the graph view (Ctrl/Cmd+G). You should see interconnected nodes for each wiki page. Isolated nodes are orphans that lint would flag.

**Dataview query:** In any note, add a code block to query the wiki (substitute your actual subdir for `03-Resources` if you changed `LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR`):

````
```dataview
TABLE date, type FROM "03-Resources/test-wiki/wiki"
SORT date DESC
```
````

This lists all wiki pages with their date and type, sorted newest first. Change `type` to filter by `concept`, `person`, or `source-summary`.

---

## Part 5: Obsidian Integration Tips

### Web Clipper

Install the [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) browser extension. In its settings:

- **Destination folder:** `03-Resources/<wiki-name>/raw/articles` (replace `03-Resources` with your `LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR` value if changed)
- **Filename template:** `{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{title}}`

After clipping an article, run:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki ingest $LLM_WIKI_VAULT/$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/<wiki-name>/raw/<clipped-file>.md
```

### Graph view as a visual lint

The graph view shows you what lint would find. Isolated nodes have no inbound links. Clusters of tightly connected nodes are your strongest knowledge areas. Thin bridges between clusters are candidates for new concept pages that would connect them.

### Dataview for wiki management

Useful queries (substitute your actual subdir for `03-Resources` if you changed `LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR`):

```dataview
TABLE date, status FROM "03-Resources/my-wiki/wiki"
WHERE type = "concept" AND status = "stale"
SORT date ASC
```

```dataview
LIST FROM "03-Resources/my-wiki/wiki"
WHERE type = "source-summary"
SORT date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Marp slide export

Any wiki page can become a slide deck. Add `marp: true` to the frontmatter, then run:

```bash
~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/marp wiki/my-page.md -o output.html
```

The source-summary template in `CLAUDE.md` includes this instruction as a reminder.

---

## Part 6: Advanced Usage

### Multiple wikis

Each topic gets its own folder under `$LLM_WIKI_SUBDIR/`. Run `init` once per topic:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki init machine-learning
/llm-wiki:wiki init company-research
/llm-wiki:wiki init book-notes
```

Active wiki detection picks the right one based on your cwd. Wikis don't share pages, but you can cross-reference between them using full Obsidian paths if needed.

### Large wikis (200+ pages)

At this scale, reading `index.md` for every query becomes slow. qmd's hybrid search handles it well. You may also want to partition `index.md` by domain, keeping each section under 50 entries.

Signs you need qmd: queries start returning vague answers, or the LLM says it can't find relevant pages. Check that qmd is installed and the collection is up to date:

```bash
~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/qmd collection list
```

### Contradiction handling

When the LLM finds conflicting information across sources, it adds a callout inline:

```markdown
> [!WARNING] Contradiction with [[other-page]]
> Source A says X, but [[other-page]] says Y. Needs resolution.
```

Lint surfaces all `[!WARNING]` markers in its report. Resolve them by reading both sources and updating the pages with the reconciled view.

### Filing query answers back

The query workflow has two promotion steps:

1. **File to `wiki/queries/`** — saves the answer as a query artifact
2. **Promote to `wiki/`** — elevates it to a first-class concept page

Use promotion when a query synthesizes something genuinely new that isn't captured in any existing page. Over time, queries become one of the primary ways the wiki grows beyond what any single source contains.

---

## Part 7: Working with Large Documents

This section covers PDFs, Word documents, and other large files that exceed a single LLM context window.

---

### Toolchain setup

Before ingesting large documents, install the optional toolchain to unlock all capabilities:

```bash
# Windows
winget install -e --id oschwartz10612.Poppler
winget install -e --id JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc

# macOS
brew install poppler pandoc

# Linux
sudo apt install poppler-utils pandoc
```

Verify:

```bash
pdftotext --version   # Poppler text extraction
pdfimages --version   # Poppler image inventory
pdftoppm --version    # Poppler page rendering
pandoc --version      # Word / EPUB / PPTX conversion
```

Without these tools, ingest still works — the plugin falls back to a single-file summary and tells you exactly what was skipped.

---

### Ingesting a large PDF

Drop the PDF into `raw/attachments/` and run ingest:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki ingest ~/ObsidianVault/03-Resources/my-wiki/raw/attachments/annual-report.pdf
```

**What happens in chapter-split mode:**

1. Detects file exceeds the size threshold (default 200 KB of extracted text)
2. Runs toolchain detection; prints one-time setup message if tools are incomplete
3. Extracts full text with `pdftotext`
4. Parses the table of contents for chapter boundaries; falls back to heading scan if no TOC
5. Writes one article file per chapter to `raw/articles/`:
   ```
   raw/articles/2026-05-09-annual-report-ch01-overview.md
   raw/articles/2026-05-09-annual-report-ch02-financials.md
   ...
   raw/articles/2026-05-09-annual-report-index.md   ← hub article
   ```
6. Each chapter file has full extracted text and frontmatter including `source-pdf-pages`, `chapter:`, and `chapter-title:`
7. If a single chapter still exceeds context, it is **sub-split** at section level — multiple files share the same `chapter:` value and each gets a `section-range:` field (e.g. `"8.1-8.3"`) identifying which sections it covers
8. If pdfimages is available, inventories images and notes diagram pages
9. If pdftoppm is available, renders diagram pages as PNG and describes them via vision

**Verify:**

```bash
ls raw/articles/  # should show N chapter files + 1 index file
cat raw/articles/2026-05-09-annual-report-index.md
cat log.md
```

---

### Compiling a chapter group

```
/llm-wiki:wiki compile
```

The compiler detects that the chapter articles share a `parent-doc` value and activates grouped compile mode:

1. Reads the hub article first to establish document context
2. Processes chapters in order, maintaining a shared entity accumulator
3. After all chapters: runs a group-level backlink audit across the full wiki
4. Creates `wiki/annual-report.md` — a hub wiki page linking all chapter wiki pages

To compile a single chapter (useful for testing):

```
/llm-wiki:wiki compile raw/articles/2026-05-09-annual-report-ch02-financials.md
```

**Verify:**

```bash
ls wiki/         # should show hub page + chapter pages + entity pages
cat wiki/annual-report.md
cat log.md
```

---

### Querying a large document

```
/llm-wiki:wiki query "What are the key financial risks identified in the annual report?"
```

The query operation detects that candidate pages have a `parent-doc` field and loads the hub wiki page first for document-level context, then reads the relevant chapter pages.

This means answers are grounded in the full document structure, not just the most similar paragraph.

---

### Retroactive splitting

If you ingested a large document before chapter-split mode was available (or before the toolchain was installed), use `split` to reprocess it:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki split raw/articles/2026-04-01-old-report.md
# or by parent-doc name:
/llm-wiki:wiki split old-report
```

**What happens:**

1. Reads the existing article file and extracts `source-url`
2. Locates the original file in `raw/attachments/`
3. Runs chapter boundary detection on the original
4. Writes per-chapter article files
5. Archives the original single-file article to `raw/articles/archive/`
6. Logs and commits

Then run `wiki compile` to integrate.

---

### Handling document revisions

When a new edition of a document arrives (e.g. a quarterly report update):

```
/llm-wiki:wiki update annual-report
```

The plugin will prompt: "Path to the new edition of annual-report?"

Provide the path to the new PDF. It compares chapter revision dates in the new TOC against existing chapter articles and re-ingests only the changed chapters. Unchanged chapters are left as-is.

```
Chapter 1 (Overview): unchanged — skipped
Chapter 2 (Financials): updated — re-ingested
Chapter 3 (Risk): updated — re-ingested
Chapter 4 (Outlook): unchanged — skipped
```

Then run `wiki compile` to update only the affected wiki pages.

---

### Large-document lint checks

`wiki lint` includes additional checks for large-document artifacts:

- **Missing hub article:** flags a `parent-doc` group with no index file — suggests `wiki split`
- **Missing hub wiki page:** hub article compiled but `wiki/<name>.md` not yet created
- **Chapter gaps:** checks the set of distinct `chapter:` values for missing numbers; multiple files sharing the same `chapter:` value are recognised as sub-splits (not gaps). Also checks `section-range:` contiguity within each sub-split chapter.
- **Stuck uncompiled sources:** chapter files with `compiled: false` older than 7 days
- **Image-set stubs:** extracted images that were never described
- **Page range overlaps:** detects duplicated or missing page ranges across chapters

---

## Part 8: Cleanup

After testing, remove the test wiki:

```
/llm-wiki:wiki remove test-wiki
```

Your real wikis are unaffected. The plugin itself stays installed.

---

## Part 9: Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `/llm-wiki:wiki` not found | Plugin not installed | `/plugin install llm-wiki@llm-wiki` |
| qmd not found | Deps not installed | Check `~/.claude/plugins/data/llm-wiki/node_modules/.bin/qmd`; start a new session to trigger the hook |
| Git commit fails | No git user configured | `git config --global user.name "Name"` and `git config --global user.email "email"` |
| Init fails "directory exists" | Previous test not cleaned up | Run `wiki remove <name>` to delete it cleanly |
| Hook doesn't run on session start | hooks.json malformed | Reinstall the plugin |
| Ingest creates no entity pages | Source too short or unstructured | Add more content to the source file |
| Query returns vague answer | Wiki too small or qmd not indexed | Ingest more sources; run `qmd embed --collection <name>` |
